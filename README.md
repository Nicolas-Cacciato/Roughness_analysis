<h3 align="center">Numerical simulation of the influence of the interfacial roughness on reflectivity measurements</h3>

## About The Project

The main idea of this numerical simulation was that the roughness of a surface affects the scattering of light and therefore the optical measurements.

The measurements were simulated with a light incidence angle of 0° (we dont want to make ellipsometry in this case).

Two methods are present, a basic method calculating for all layers and a method called EMA (effective medium approximation).
